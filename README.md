# Priming-Sugar-Calculator-Per-Bottle

Welcome to the Github page for my Excel tool.

The latest version of the tool can be easily found by checking the timestamps
of the table above.
This will show how long ago a file was committed to the page.

And you need to check for the latest version
number described in the text of the commits (V2, V3, V4, etc.).

To find the download page you need to click on the text:
"Bottling sugar calculator - Per bottle-V[..].xlsm". This text link can
be found on the left side of the table.

After pressing this link, the download button can be found
on the bottom right side of the page.
Click the button, and store the file where you want.

Let me know if anything is unclear, or wrong with the tool.

Have some good homebrews!
